# GPT VR
A non-linear story told by generative AI, experienced in a 3D world (VR). This is the outline of the idea for such a project using Agile Methodology.

## Epic

AI-Driven Interactive Storytelling in Virtual Reality

## Description

Develop a prototype that combines generative AI and VR technologies to create immersive, interactive, and non-linear storytelling experiences. The project aims to explore the potential of AI-generated narratives in VR environments, allowing users to engage with dynamic stories that evolve based on their actions and choices.

## Business Outcome

By creating a unique and engaging storytelling experience, the project aims to attract attention from investors, collaborators, and the broader public. The prototype could serve as the foundation for a commercial product or platform, opening up new markets and opportunities in the entertainment, education, and training sectors.

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if the prototype demonstrates:

- Effective integration of generative AI and VR technologies
- High-quality, engaging, and immersive narrative experiences
- Interactivity and non-linear storytelling elements
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders

## Scope and Key Features:

- Integration of generative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) for narrative generation
- Development of VR environments and assets using platforms like Unity
- Implementation of interactive storytelling mechanics and character interactions
- Support for multi-user experiences and social interaction
- Iterative development and testing process to refine and improve the prototype

## Risks and Dependencies:

- Technical challenges related to AI integration and VR development
- Potential legal or ethical concerns related to AI-generated content
- Availability of skilled resources across different domains (AI, VR, game design, etc.)
- User acceptance and engagement with AI-driven storytelling experiences
