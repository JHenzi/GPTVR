# GPT VR

A non-linear story told by generative AI, experienced in a 3D world (VR). This is the outline of the idea for such a project using Agile Methodology. This repo sets out to describe the product and outcomes of such an idea. It can be freely copied, modified, and distributed. This serves as the framework for and inspiration for such an application. The goal is to see this developed by someone or an entity that is capable of implementing such a project. The author of this project requests only that the source of the concept be tied back to this repository should it be the inspiration for or the basis for such an application.

### Epic

AI-Driven Interactive Storytelling in Virtual Reality

### Vision Statement

Given the advances in large language models to produce content that is creative, engaging and thoughtful we propose that AI agents should be able to help craft, tell and show users a story - based on the user's suggested content.

A user should be able to provide the system with a prompt, a setting, time period or other inspiration for the agents to craft a new and creative story. Working together the agents will then work on providing the user with the story in the form of a generated virtual world.

Given that AI models are capable of producing content such as code, text and images we propose to extend their capabilities into the ability (training) to create virtual worlds by implementing a generative language model focused on producing 3D content. The model would construct a virtual scene and work with a master model to generate the story content that matches the world the user is experiencing.

### Description

Develop a prototype that combines generative AI and VR technologies to create immersive, interactive, and non-linear storytelling experiences. The project aims to explore the potential of AI-generated narratives in VR environments, allowing users to engage with dynamic stories that evolve based on their actions and choices.

### Business Outcome

By creating a unique and engaging storytelling experience, the project aims to attract attention from investors, collaborators, and the broader public. The prototype could serve as the foundation for a commercial product or platform, opening up new markets and opportunities in the entertainment, education, and training sectors.

### Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if the prototype demonstrates:

- Effective integration of generative AI and VR technologies
- High-quality, engaging, and immersive narrative experiences
- Interactivity and non-linear storytelling elements
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders

### Scope and Key Features

- Integration of generative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) for narrative generation
- Development of VR environments and assets using platforms like Unity
- Implementation of interactive storytelling mechanics and character interactions
- Support for multi-user experiences and social interaction
- Iterative development and testing process to refine and improve the prototype

### Risks and Dependencies

- Technical challenges related to AI integration and VR development
- Potential legal or ethical concerns related to AI-generated content
- Availability of skilled resources across different domains (AI, VR, game design, etc.)
- User acceptance and engagement with AI-driven storytelling experiences

## Deliverables & Scope

### Project Title

AI-Driven Interactive Storytelling in Virtual Reality

### Project Objective

To develop a prototype that combines generative AI and VR technologies for immersive, interactive, and non-linear storytelling experiences.

### Project Outcomes

- AI Integration: Successfully integrate a generative AI model, such as ChatGPT, into the project to generate narrative elements, character dialogue, and other text-based content.

- VR Environment: Develop a visually appealing and immersive VR environment using a platform like Unity, complete with 3D models, textures, animations, and other necessary assets.

- Interactive Storytelling: Implement interactive storytelling mechanics, allowing users to engage with dynamic stories that evolve based on their actions and choices.

- Character Interaction: Create realistic and engaging character interactions driven by the AI-generated dialogue and behavior.

- Multi-user Experience: Develop support for multiple users to simultaneously participate in the narrative world, enabling social interaction and collaboration within the experience.

- Usability and Immersion: Ensure the prototype offers a user-friendly, engaging, and immersive experience, based on feedback from user testing and stakeholder input.

### Deliverables

- Project Plan: A comprehensive project plan outlining the project scope, timeline, milestones, and resource requirements.

- AI Integration: Custom APIs or adapted existing ones to enable seamless communication between the AI model (e.g., ChatGPT) and the VR development platform (e.g., Unity).

- VR Environment Assets: A collection of 3D models, textures, animations, and other assets necessary for creating the VR environment.

- Prototype Application: A functional prototype application that demonstrates the integration of generative AI and VR technologies for interactive storytelling.

- User Testing Results: Results and feedback from user testing sessions, along with recommendations for improvements and refinements to the prototype.

- Final Report: A comprehensive final report detailing the project's achievements, challenges, lessons learned, and potential future developments.
